<h1>Creation of clock with images from Rijksmuseum online collection</h1>

  <h2> Pre history</h2>
<p>
  Participated in hackathon Hacking the Walls. That organized by Tower of David Museum.
  From here, my interest in connection between museums and technology. Afterwards watched
  on YouTube lecture. That was in Tower of David Museum.
  <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP_AqBQx_2A">The Museum Visitor Experience in the Digital Age â€“ Part II</a>
  Inspired by it. Created memory game with use of Rijksmuseum online collection. And TicTacToe
  with images from The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</p>

<h2>Creation of the clock</h2>
<p>
  I use Processing a programming language. Resently started use p5js. That very similar to
  Processing but allow develop for web. Created this clock for practice p5js. Created designs
  in Inkscape. And choosed one of them.That seem to me better and also simple create code for him.
</p>

<h2> Plans for future </h2>
<p>
  Add more designs to the clock. With given ability to user, choose what design prefer. And maybe
  add images from more online collections.
